# Instant replay

## <ins> Introduction

I created this piece of code because I have trouble using NVIDIA's shadow play when I'm just on my dekstop, not in a game.
I've tried lots of things to fix the issues but ended up just coding my own AUDIO version.

I was not interested in having a visual replay, only an audio one, so that's what I did.

## <ins> TODO

- Test how it acts when the microphone changes while the program is running

- Either Save the audio on disk instead of in memory or store the .mp4 version is memory.
Because it uses quite a bit of memory since I'm keeping the .wav version is memory
